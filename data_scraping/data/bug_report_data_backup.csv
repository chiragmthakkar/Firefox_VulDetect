in Network Security Services (NSS) where the client allows for a ECDHE_ECDSA
exchange where the server does not send its <code>ServerKeyExchange</code>
message instead of aborting the handshake. Instead, the NSS client will take the
EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has
some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation, the browser
thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange, but has been silently downgraded to a
non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result, if <code>False
Start</code> is enabled, the browser will start sending data encrypted under
these non-forward-secret connection keys. This issue was fixed in NSS version

during their operation. In versions of OS X from versions 10.6 through 10.9, the

applications that use a custom memory allocator, such as <code>jemalloc</code>,
because of an initialization bug in the framework. This issue has been addressed
in Mozilla products by explicitly turning off the framework's logging of input
events. On vulnerable systems, this issue can result in private data such as
usernames, passwords, and other inputed data being saved to a log file on the
local system.

",Moderate,"September 27, 2011","<strong>Ian Graham</strong> of Citrix Online reported that when multiple
<code>Location</code> headers were present in a redirect response 
Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers: Mozilla would use the second
<code>Location</code> header while Chrome and Internet Explorer would use
the first. Two copies of this header with different values could be a symptom
of a CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most commonly it is
the <code>Location</code> header itself that is vulnerable to the response
splitting and therefore the copy preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be
the malicious one. It is possible, however, that the first copy was the
injected one depending on the nature of the server vulnerability.
